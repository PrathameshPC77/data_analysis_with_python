You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

        "> **Q**: Shaun is currently paying back a home loan for a house he bought a few years ago. The cost of the house was `$800,000`. Shaun made a down payment of `25%` of the price. He financed the remaining amount using a 6-year loan with an interest rate of `7%` per annum (compounded monthly). Shaun is now buying a car worth `$60,000`, which he is planning to finance using a 1-year loan with an interest rate of `12%` per annum. Both loans are paid back in EMIs. What is the total monthly payment Shaun makes towards loan repayment?\n",
